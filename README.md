# Pug Support - Advanced for VS Code

This extension provides comprehensive, professional-grade language support for Pug (formerly Jade) files in Visual Studio Code. Inspired by the powerful features found in JetBrains IDEs' Pug/Jade plugins, this extension aims to bring a similar level of advanced functionality and developer experience to VS Code users working with Pug/Jade.

## ‚ú® Key Features

This extension offers a rich set of features to enhance your Pug/Jade development workflow:

### üé® Enhanced Language Support
*   **Advanced Syntax Highlighting**: Accurate and detailed syntax highlighting for both `.pug` and `.jade` files, including robust support for interpolations.
*   **Intelligent Code Completion**: Context-aware autocompletion for Pug keywords, HTML tags, CSS class names (based on project files), and defined mixins.
*   **Rich Hover Information**: Display detailed documentation and examples for Pug constructs on hover.
*   **Smart Snippets**: A collection of useful code snippets for common Pug patterns and HTML structures, accelerating development (`package.json` lists over 15 built-in snippets).

### üß≠ Advanced Navigation & Structure
*   **Go to Definition (F12)**:
    *   **Mixins**: Seamlessly jump to mixin definitions, **even if they are located in files included via `include` directives or in parent templates via `extends`**.
    *   **Includes & Extends**: Quickly navigate to included or extended Pug files.
*   **Find All References (Shift+F12)**: Locate all usages of mixins and references to specific Pug files across your workspace.
*   **Document Outline (Ctrl+Shift+O)**: View a structured outline of the current Pug file, showing mixins, blocks, and included files for quick navigation.
*   **Workspace Symbol Search (Ctrl+T)**: Find Pug-specific symbols (like mixins) across your entire project.
*   **Document Highlights**: Automatic highlighting of related symbols (e.g., all instances of a selected mixin).
*   **Code Folding**: Collapse and expand mixins, blocks, conditional statements, and large HTML tag structures for better readability.

### üí° Intelligent Assistance & Validation
*   **Real-time Validation**: Leverages the official `pug-lexer` and `pug-parser` for accurate, real-time syntax checking and error reporting as you type.
*   **Signature Help**: Displays parameter information for mixin calls, helping you understand the expected arguments.
*   **Code Actions & Quick Fixes**: Provides suggestions and automatic fixes for common issues (e.g., undefined mixins, indentation problems).
*   **Path Validation**: Validates file paths used in `include` and `extends` directives, warning about non-existent files.
*   **Indentation Validation**: Detects and warns about inconsistent indentation (e.g., mixed tabs and spaces).
*   **Mixin Analysis**: Identifies undefined mixin calls and potentially unused mixin definitions.

### üîÑ Professional Refactoring Tools
*   **Symbol Renaming (F2)**: Intelligently rename mixins across your entire workspace, updating all call sites.
*   **File Path Updates**: Automatically updates `include` and `extends` paths when Pug files are moved or renamed within the VS Code explorer.
*   **Extract to Mixin/File**: (Planned/Future) Refactor selected Pug code into a new mixin or a separate file.

### üìÅ Workspace & Project Management
*   **File Watcher**: Monitors Pug files for changes (e.g., new mixin definitions, file renames) and updates its internal understanding of the project to keep features like "Go to Definition" accurate.
*   **Dependency Tracking**: (Basic) The extension analyzes `include` and `extends` to understand file relationships. (Advanced visualization planned).
*   **Create Pug File from Template**: Quickly scaffold new Pug files using predefined templates (accessible via context menu or command).
*   **Find TODOs in Workspace**: A command to scan all Pug files in the current workspace for `TODO`, `FIXME`, or similar comment tags.
*   **Compile Pug to HTML**: A command to compile the current Pug file to HTML (primarily for quick previews or simple use cases).
*   **List File Dependencies**: A command to display the files that the current Pug file includes or extends.

### üíÑ Formatting
*   **Document Formatting**: Integrates with Prettier (if installed and configured with `@prettier/plugin-pug`) to format Pug documents according to your Prettier configuration (`Shift+Alt+F` or context menu).

## üöÄ Installation

1.  Open Visual Studio Code.
2.  Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
3.  Search for "Pug Support - Advanced".
4.  Click "Install".

Alternatively, for development or testing:
1.  Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/vscode-extension-pug.git` (Replace with actual URL if different)
2.  Navigate to the cloned directory: `cd vscode-extension-pug/pug-support`
3.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
4.  Open the `pug-support` folder in VS Code.
5.  Press `F5` to launch the Extension Development Host with the extension loaded.

## üìñ Usage Guide

Once installed, the extension automatically activates when you open a `.pug` or `.jade` file.

*   **Navigation**: Use `F12` (Go to Definition), `Shift+F12` (Find All References), `Ctrl+Shift+O` (Document Outline), and `Ctrl+T` (Workspace Symbols).
*   **Intelligent Assistance**: Autocompletion will trigger as you type. Hover over Pug elements for more information. Signature help appears when you type `(` after a mixin name.
*   **Formatting**: Right-click in a Pug file and select "Format Document" or use the shortcut `Shift+Alt+F`.
*   **Commands**: Access additional features through the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) by typing "Pug:" or "Pug Support:".

## üéõÔ∏è Available Commands

Access these commands via the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P):

*   `Pug Support: Find TODOs in Workspace` (`pug-support.findTodos`): Scans all Pug files for TODO/FIXME comments.
*   `Pug Support: Create Pug File from Template` (`pug-support.createFromTemplate`): Creates a new Pug file from a predefined template.
*   `Pug Support: Compile Pug to HTML` (`pug-support.compileToHtml`): Compiles the current Pug file to HTML.
*   `Pug Support: List File Dependencies` (`pug-support.listFileDependencies`): Shows includes/extends for the current file.
*   `Pug: Format Pug Document` (`pug.format`): Formats the current Pug document (relies on Prettier).
*   `Pug: Validate Pug Document` (`pug.validate`): Manually triggers validation for the current Pug document.

*(Note: Some command titles might slightly differ based on `package.json` display names vs. command IDs)*

## üîß Configuration

The extension generally respects your global VS Code editor settings for:
*   **Tab Size**
*   **Insert Spaces**

For document formatting, it relies on your project's Prettier configuration if Prettier and `@prettier/plugin-pug` are set up.

## üìã Code Snippets

The extension includes a variety of snippets for common Pug/HTML patterns. Start typing common keywords (e.g., `html5`, `mixin`, `if`, `each`, `include`, `block`, `form`, `table`, `a`, `img`) to see available snippets.

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

*   **Complex Project Structures**: Path resolution for `include`/`extends` in very complex or unusually structured projects might have edge cases.
*   **Performance**: For extremely large projects with thousands of Pug files, some features like workspace-wide symbol searching or reference finding might experience slight delays. Continuous optimizations are planned.
*   **HTML Compilation**: The `Compile Pug to HTML` command is intended for basic preview and might not support all advanced Pug features or build pipeline integrations.
*   **TypeScript Configuration in Dev**: Some minor TypeScript configuration warnings might appear during development mode of the extension itself.

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap / Future Work

*   **Live HTML Preview**: A dedicated pane for real-time HTML preview as you type in Pug.
*   **Enhanced IntelliSense**: Deeper IntelliSense, potentially including completion for variables and functions passed to Pug templates from a JavaScript context (if feasible to detect).
*   **Advanced Project-wide Analysis**: More sophisticated dependency graphs, detection of circular dependencies, and unused file warnings.
*   **Template Gallery & Customization**: Expand the built-in templates and allow users to define their own project-specific templates.
*   **Build Tool Integration**: Better integration with common build tools like Webpack, Gulp, etc., for tasks like compilation.
*   **Refactoring Enhancements**: Introduce more refactoring options like "Extract to File" and improve existing ones.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This extension is built using:
*   **TypeScript**: For type-safe development and leveraging the full VS Code API.
*   **VS Code API**: Native integration with editor features like language services, commands, and UI elements.
*   **`pug-lexer`**: The official Pug lexical analyzer for tokenizing Pug source code.
*   **`pug-parser`**: The official Pug parser for generating Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and performing structural analysis.
